This extra simple logging "anti-framework", was hosted at dev.java.net, but recently was removed from there. Luckily I could track down it's [SVN repository](http://java.net/nonav/projects/simple-log/sources/svn/show) and have it's 3 classes (yes, that's all there is) directly integrated into Panama.

Copyright still is by Graham Lea.

See the [documentation in the SVN](http://java.net/nonav/projects/simple-log/sources/svn/content/trunk/www) for further information (I really should move that to this wiki too).
