#summary How to use different configuration sets.

Often you'll have your web application developed locally on your machine and then deployed to a test-server and a production-server.

For the test- and production servers you'll probably want different configurations (database, logging, caching, ...).

== System Properties ==

A relatively simple way to achieve this, is to have different properties files and to tell the web-application which to use via System properties (add those to the launch command of the Java VM via `-Dpropertyname=value`.

=== Ebean ===

By default, Ebean reads its configuration from `ebean.properties`. To make it use another file, set the system-property *`ebean.props.file`*

To have different JNDI datasources, simply define multiple Datasource Resources in META-INF/context.xml (as described in Documentation#Ebean_ORM_with_JNDI) and specify the correct one in the appropriate ebean properties via `ebean.jndi.dataSourceJndiName`

=== Velocity ===

By default, Velocity reads its configuration from `velocity.properties`. To make it use another file, set the system-property *`panama.velocity.configuration`*.

Even `contextname.veclocity.configuration` is possible here and would affect only the web-application with the given contextname.

=== Logging ===

By default, Logging reads its configuration from `simplelog.properties`. To make it use another file, set the system-property *`simplelog.configuration`*.

=== Quartz ===

Quartz is not part of Panama but often used in web-applications.
By default, Quartz reads its configuration from `quartz.properties`. To make it use another file, set the system-property *`org.quartz.properties`*.
